# Engineering Management Resources
A repository with resources on the challenges you might encounter as an engineering manager. I try to highlight multiple sides of the same topic since, as a manager, you'll more likely than not answer questions by saying "It depends". Inspired by curated collections like How They Test.

# Thinking And Modelling Techniques
> Techniques used to structure problem solving and find potential pitfalls

To me, thinking techniques are an essential skill for any engineering manager (or any manager at all). If you want to get to root causes of certain issues, get a better view of what the catalysts and pitfalls are in the workflow,... thinking techniques are invaluable. It allows me to challenge my own assumptions and come to a logical conclusion.

# Software Testing
> Understand the job of a tester and their challenges

I got into software development through software testing, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. More importantly, though, is that I find testability one of the major factors in long-term success of any software application - so understanding the challenges and struggles your testers are facing is key to proper management of your applications.
