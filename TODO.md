# TODO list

Concepts & knowledge that I've gathered over the years but have not found a good (singular) source on that I'm happy with. There's a lot of information out there on these concepts, but a lot of it is flawed, too high-level, or commercially-driven. You'll see most of these referenced throughout the other books and articles in the main collection.
